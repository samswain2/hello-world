# hello-world
Part 1:
My first repository on this account.

I have another github account that I made for Python and Data Science (STAT 430) during my undergraduate degree. I intend for this account to be my main account from now on.

I received my undergraduate degree in statistics and economics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In approximately three months I will be attending Northwestern University to attain a masters of science in analytics. 

I am excited to pursue a career as a data scientist. I love working with data as there are so many questions that it can answer. The only requirement is that one knows how to extract the information that will answer each question.

Hello future Sam! Please update this in the future. This will be part one!
